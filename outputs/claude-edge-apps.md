Here are 10 edge case app ideas:

1. **Spite Gym** - Converts your anger at specific people into workout motivation by letting you symbolically "punch their face" with each rep.

2. **Last Words** - Schedule messages to be sent to people after you die, with proof-of-life check-ins to prevent accidental sends.

3. **Fake Commute** - Simulates your old commute (podcast, coffee stop, walk) for remote workers who miss the transition ritual.

4. **Shelf Respect** - Scan your bookshelf and it auto-generates impressive literary references for dinner parties based on books you actually own but haven't read.

5. **Spite Bid** - Alerts you when your ex or nemesis is viewing a property/item online so you can outbid them.

6. **Parent Decrypt** - Translates older relatives' vague texts and voicemails into actionable information ("Call me" = urgency level + likely topic prediction).

7. **Crowd Allergy** - Uses local event data, transit schedules, and real-time mapping to route you away from crowds, protests, and marathons.

8. **Dinner Amnesty** - Lets dinner party guests anonymously flag allergens/foods they hate so hosts can plan menus without awkward conversations.

9. **Plant Guilt** - Your dying houseplants send increasingly desperate notifications and final goodbye messages to shame you into watering them.

10. **Meeting Cosplay** - AI generates your digital twin for low-priority video meetings while you do literally anything else.
